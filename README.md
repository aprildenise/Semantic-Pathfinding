Semantic Pathfinding

Note: I am only going to push my code to the git, since the entire Unity Project is too big. For now, I will put notes on how to set up the code in Unity (ie. which references/objects go in the inspector) in here.

AbstractMaze.c 
In Unity: 
- Create an empty gameobject with the script component Abstract Maze
- Add the following references in the component:
    - BottomRight: Object_182
    - TopRight: Object_444
    - TopLeft: Object_480
